# dark-channel-prior

Purpose: Study the Dark Channel Prior method to dehaze image.

K. He, J. Sun and X. Tang, "Single Image Haze Removal Using Dark Channel Prior," in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 33, no. 12, pp. 2341-2353, Dec. 2011, doi: 10.1109/TPAMI.2010.168.

Ported from https://github.com/mshr-h/Image_Dehazing.

I have simplified the data structure and put all necessary code in only 1 main file.

Tested on Ubuntu-18.04, OpenCV-4.4.0.
